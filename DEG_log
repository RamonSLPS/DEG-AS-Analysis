## Calling of the packages that will be necessary for this analysis.
library(tximport)
library(tximportData)
library(readr)
library(GenomicFeatures)
library(DESeq2)

## Create an object named "gtf_dir" containing the path to your reference GTF file.
  ## You can use the same command to import GFF annotations just by changing the file format in the pathway.
gtf_dir <- "path/to/your/data/dataset.gtf"
## Create an TxDb container parting from GTF files to store your study subject transcript annotation data.
  ## Only specify the format of your file if the program couldn't identify it, in most cases just use "auto".
txdb <- makeTxDbFromGFF(file=gtf_dir, format="auto", 
dataSource="A string containing informations about the origin of the annotation used to build this TxDb",
organism="specific name of the font of this GTF file")
    ## Pay attention to the correct spelling of the name of the genos and the species of the subject, it will be very useful to the program to access
    important information about it.
## You can save your TxDb container in a file if you want, using the command ... and loading it again with ... when necessary.
  ## Doing it can be useful to shorten the time of this analysis.

# Create an text file named "samples.txt" in a tsv-like format containing primarily the run and condition columns as they are identified in your directory.
  ## For easily pathing to ir, put in the root directory of the quantifications.
  
## Create an object named "samp_dir" containing the path to the root directory of your salmon quantification files.
samp_dir <- "path/to/your/salmon/quantifications"
## Read the "samples.txt" file, pointing its path and name it as an data frame named "samples".
samples <- read.table(file.path(dir, "samples.txt"), header=TRUE)
## Create an tx2gene dataframe which links "transcript ID" and "Gene ID".
keys <- keys(txdb, keytype="TXNAME")
tx2gene <- select(txdb, keys,"GENEID", "TXNAME")
## Create an dataframe named "files" and point the program to retrieve the "quant.sf" files in each run directories based on the run names provided before.
files <- file.path(dir, "salmon", samples$run, "quant.sf")
names(files) <- paste0("sample", 1:6)
## Proceed to import your salmon quantification files combining all the objects built until now.
txi.salmon <- tximport(files, type="salmon", tx2gene=tx2gene, ignoreTxVersion=TRUE)

## Create an DESeq base dataframe named "dds" parting from the built Tximport "importation" object
  ## in the colData parameter, you can provide the already made dataframe containing each run information built named "samples".
  ## the design option is used to point out your study comparative design in a equation format, in this case I just pointed the run column as the unique
  comparative parameter.
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromTximport(txi.salmon, colData=samples, design=~condition)
## Run the Differential Expression Analysis and create an object containing the results of this analysis named "dseq_res".
dds <- DESeq(dds)
dseq_res <- results(dds)

## You can save the result table with the command:
  write.csv(dseq_res, "directory/where/you/want/to/save/DEG_results.csv")
